# StardewValley
I really love Stardew Valley so I decided to make a mini-project honoring my love! :D
A Webapp made completely in React and styled in CSS that utilizes react-rerouting to navigate to different pages. The website is completely responsive and is comprised of different reusable components. Data is taken from the official Stardew Valley wiki page and the NPCs are displayed.

I developed this website while learning the Reactjs framework. Through this project I learned about:

> React-rerouting,
> 
> useState hook,
> 
> useEffect hook,
> 
> Lifting up states and,
> 
> netlify deployment,
